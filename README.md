# Discord.js v14 Mocks

This repository contains mocks for the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

I created this repository because I wanted to write tests for my Discord bots, but I didn't want to use the real Discord.js library. I wanted to use a mock library that would allow me to test my code without having to worry about the Discord API. I also wanted to be able to test my code without having to worry about the Discord API.

I found a repository that had this as a good base but I wanted more control over the dependencies and the mocks. So I created this repository.

The source was: [AnswerOverflow](https://github.com/AnswerOverflow/AnswerOverflow) and their [Discord.js Mocks](https://github.com/AnswerOverflow/AnswerOverflow/tree/main/packages/discordjs-mock)
